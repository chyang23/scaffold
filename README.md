# scaffold: simulating single-cell RNA-seq data

`scaffold` is an R package for generating scRNA-seq data by
statistically modelling each step of the experimental
process.

Currently, the only way to install `scaffold` is through GitHub:

> devtools::install_github("rhondabacher/scaffold",
build_vignette=TRUE)

You can then view the vignette by running:

> browseVignettes("scaffold")
